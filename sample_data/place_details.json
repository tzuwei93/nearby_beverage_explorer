I was so surprised so I asked the shop owner why the house special blend coffee was with milk and sugar and tasted like 3-in-1? She just replied it's how they make it and said it uses same coffee beans like the americano my friend ordered. Are you kidding me? I pay NTD120 for house special when the americano only costs NTD100 just because you \"helped\" to \"blend\" in the sugar and milk that I don't need? And come on, even Starbucks gives milk and sugar without extra charge. I tried my friend's americano and I can guarantee you it's not the same coffee beans used in the so called \"house special blend\". I can tolerate the rundown place, but zero tolerance to the poor quality 3-in-1 in a cafe that claims themselves offer boutique coffee beans.",

I\u2019m visiting town for conference and just happened to run into this place not knowing what to expect and WOW, what a cute cafe full of surprises! Cozy environment, cute cats, friendly owners, everything in the store was very comforting.\n\nThe food was hearty (I ordered braised beef rice and pan-fried dumplings) and the milk tea tasted very fresh (I think it was meant to be sweet and I asked for little sweet assuming US standard, here I think that means more like 10% sweetness). Seemed like they also have a pretty unique craft beer selection as well, but they were out of the toasty lager so I didn\u2019t get to try the beers\u2026\n\nIf you want to get the vibe of how the locals really live, I\u2019d take a visit once in a while!",

Despite my broken mandarin I was able to order a hand drip coffee. I watched as the barista carefully made the pour over and tasted it before approving the carafe to be sent over to me. The Ethiopia G1 was delicious and the notes were just as described fruity, vibrant, and juicy.  I wanted to try a cup of the house blend beans as well but apparently that is for espresso only.  Perhaps the barista took pity on me because gave me a cup of something on the house. Unfortunately I was too late to order an espresso because earlier I saw him methodically take off the hopper and store the beans and clean out the espresso grinder.  10/10 experience, even more so being at 11pm.  I'll be back tomorrow morning to grab an espresso!",

( Siphon and pour over same price)\n\nNice presentation with explanation of the beans. The chocolate girl really tastes like her name: nuts, butter, chocolate with hint of cocoa.

The buns at Manfu Burger may not be as soft as hamburger buns (hamburger buns are more suitable for children), but they are full of bite and worth savoring!\nHowever, I also think that McDonald's has learned a bad lesson. In order to support McCafe, it often tries to upgrade the coffee or adjust the price. Because there is a 7-11 across the road, and what's even more lamentable is that there is a Cama Coffee next to it.\nTherefore, I have been ordering a Full Burger at McDonald's recently, walking to Cana across the street to buy an American or vanilla latte, and then returning to McDonald's to get a Full Burger. I feel full of happiness and have a huge CP value!\nYou...you can try it too!",

In the most recent visit, it seems like the barista is less experienced and the milk didn't froth well... I pointed it out to the server and a more experienced barista made us a new one.\n\nRegarding service, the male servers are usually fine but there's this female server who seems like she doesn't care at all...\n\nFIRST VISIT (5 stars\u2b50)\nFlat white with Ethiopia beans is so good! It's a medium light roast with very floral notes but without the acidity. Highly recommend!\n\nThere were many seats inside and plenty of charging outlets available. WiFi is free and reliable. Great for working (if you don't need to be in meetings).",

          "text": "Overall great coffee! But if you're buying speciality coffee bean boxes be wary of empty satchels (these are sample boxes that are identical to the product).\n\nAttended Fika Fika on a lazy Sunday early afternoon. It was very busy although that might be attributable to the holiday period.\n\nThe ambience was good. Decor was reminiscent of a certain Scandinavian brand. Minimalistic and pleasant. Service was great, we were asked if we were enjoying our coffee on three separate occasions (perhaps because of our intense gazes). But I will just give bonus points for engaged service. I am big fan of their prominently featured nonconventional styled espresso machine.\n\nWe had two filter coffees and the coffee soft serve.\n\nThe coffee soft serve was great. It was a very light coffee taste with a sprinkling of ganache. The combination of crunch and soft serve was great and the mild coffee flavour definitely gave it a more dessert(y) feel.\n\nFor the coffee we had the Colombian Villa Clara Estate Washed. It is labelled a caramel and nut flavour profile (and you certainly get that aroma if you let it sit) but I found more often the flavour profile was a wild floral.\n\nWe also ordered the Taiwan Nanshou Baisheng Village 68 Hours Anoerobic Fermentation. That was a very interesting experience. There is a fermented bean element there, it was a coffee that certainly seemed to be reminiscent of Taiwanese food. I also got a slight mantou bun flavour on the back of the tongue. It tasted like a medium/dark roast. If you go in with the expectation of something a little unusual that tastes more like an accompaniment to a meal than an afternoon coffee it should go well.",

I heard that there was only one counter service person in the whole store. I stayed there for two hours and there was only one person, so it was basically too busy. I ordered a cup of fruit tea and just waited for the fruit tea to be ready. , so it takes almost 15 minutes. I personally think it is a bit long, but the service attitude of the counter staff is good and they are smiling. The clean environment on site is clean. As for the price, I think the price is really good. A pretty cheap fruit tea, if I remember correctly it was $60. I drank it hot and it tasted really good. You can also adjust the sweetness.

Lets the natural flavors of other ingredients show, specially the \"natural\" lemon sweetness.\nSourness: \u2705 - soft acidity, natural lime taste, quite refreshing and zetsy.\nIce: \ud83c\udd97 - about 1/2 of the glass. Which made the drink somewhat watery by the end.\nVisuals: \u2705 - esthetically pleasant and appealing. Fresh lime zest and slice, plus thyme leafs on top.\n*The thyme pairs up nicely with both the citrus and coffee taste, specially as an aromatic aftertaste.\n\nThe place has a quite nice \"fancy\" and cozy atmosphere, perfect for chatting, hanging out, or working/studying.

A little on the pricier side but well worth it and everything was delicious. During my second visit, we tried the Thai Tea (in a bear glass, $160 NT), Matcha Latte ($220 NT), Matcha Crepe Cake with matcha syrup and a side of fresh mangos ($240 NT), and lemon and earl grey madelines ($38 NT each).\n\nThey usually have seats available during the weekdays and you can walk in. If you decide to come on the weekend, make sure to reserve in advance or be prepared to wait.",

When I first into the store, the smell of the croffle hits me hard that I gotta orders one.\n\nTried their latte with almond milk ( I usually have oat latte but because of the voucher I got gotta choose the oat milk one) it was good but I was expecting the coffee flavor could be a bit stronger. Maybe I\u2019ll add another shot next time.\n\nAs a huge matcha fan, I ordered the matcha croffle. Gotta say that it\u2019s relatively huge compared to the other croffle store I\u2019ve eaten in Taipei. Price wise was pretty reasonable. The croffle was so crispy ( it\u2019s not mochi-like texture ones but I love their crispy tastes)\n\nOwner and staff was kind and nice. Seeing their store vision and color \u201cyellow,\u201d suddenly can brighten your day. It\u2019s a nice \u201c shelter\u201d place when you feel low or just want to hide from the reality, or hiding from the rain.\n\nWill be back try different flavor croffles :)",

I didn't meet him but it turns out that this is a pretty good place to study or relax/read while enjoying a drink. There's usually a steady stream of people on the side that sells glasses so it's not too quiet, and while there are only a couple of tables in the front, they usually seem to be open. The baristas generally don't seem very nice or helpful, but they also aren't rude. I've only ever tried the \u9bae\u8089\u871c\u67da (grapefruit oolong tea which I like a lot) and the \u5c0f\u828b\u5713\u5976\u8336 (taro balls milk tea). I would recommend against getting full sugar though! I always reduce sugar anyway but my friend got a bubble milk tea with full sugar... the bubbles were fine but it was almost undrinkable with how sweet it was (even for her, and she likes sweet drinks).",

There are only a few seats available but it\u2019s also not too crowded on weekday afternoon. Free wifi here and the tables are big enough. No time limit on weekdays. I\u2019d recommend anyone who is searching for a place to study or work during weekdays.\n\nFood is nice. We ordered a slice of lemon cake and a big cookie. The cookie is filled with melted chocolate, which is what I\u2019d call the comfort food. As for the drink, the Scottish black tea is fused with butter and light spices. It\u2019s worth a try. I regret not taking the butter toast. The house smelled like a freshly baked bread when someone ordered the toast. I\u2019d definitely go back and try this one!\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a go to place around NTU campus if you\u2019re searching for a corner to read/study.",

But I think they now have a new policy where your minimum order must include a drink, you can't just order a pancake or waffles or dessert or a main meal, you have to order a drink even if you order any of the above. It's quite a strange policy, I'm sure there is a reason for it, it's my first time seeing a restaurant with this policy. Not here to complain, but just informing other guests that this policy exists. It was unfortunate, because at the end we didn't have a chance to taste their food.",

They offer oat milk (oatly) and teas.\n\nDacquoise are refrigerated, so I waited to let it reach room temp before trying. It has a slightly cakier chew, so I think it was refrigerated a while for the filling to moisten the shells.\n\nWould like to try more of their fruit and tea drinks.\n\n** Since JAN 2022, the plot across the street is demolished and has been under heavy construction. I think once the windows and doors are closed, the noise is diminished, but still audible over the music.\n\n3.5 - Would return, particularly to work.",
